## Interesting things

- On the background it's implemented a working [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) simulation.

  Through the menu (in the upper left part) you can explore the settings and build or load a pattern.

  The only difference with the original one is that the space of the simulation is not infinite, so when active cells arrive to the borders they'll act a bit differently.

- It is also indexed on search engines
